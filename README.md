<h1>Andrea Gonz√°lez | JS FullStack Developer & UI/UX Designer</h1>
<h2>I enjoy making usable, accessible, beautiful products... and catsüê±.

I develop full stack JavaScript applications with several technologies including Vuejs, React, Express, HTML, CSS and vanilla JS, concentrating more on the front of the front-end./h2>
<p>Repo for my blog and developer porfolio built with Gatsby! If you like it, feel free to clone it and tweak it for your own needs, I'll probably transform it into a Gatsby theme soon.</p>
