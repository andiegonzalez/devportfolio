I knew that sooner or later I would have to get it together. Not only to achieve my goals or my dreams or whatever, but because what I was doing day to day was only going to get me so far. I don't know why I thought this would last me longer, but in a weird way I'm glad it happened now.

## What Happened

As we're all aware, the pandemic came to shake everyone's health, fears, anxieties and life in general in a pretty drasti way. And like many of us, little by little these changes, seemingly without me noticing, started eating away at me. The constant worries, the moving back home, the lack of space, the common routine of not knowing what was next. I started closing in on myself, focusing one day at a time until something made sense again.
Once I moved to Mexico City, things started looking up. I was happier, I had my own space, I was living with my boyfriend, I had more power over my routine, everything seemed to get better...until it didn't.

Symptoms started creeping up: the fatigue, the loneliness, the tiredness, the low energy, the hopelesness, the sadness, the insomnia. All at once, all encompassing. I kept going over these things with my therapist, around and around in circles trying to find the root of all my symptoms, of all my feelings, getting desperate to find a solution to what I was feeling. I tried, but nothing seemed to work, or make me feel at least a little bit better. It went on until my therapist suggested to look into hormone imbalances, insulin resistance, or a thyroid issue. My symptoms had lasted for too long, and they didn't seem like a feelings issue entirely.

After taking it serously, and because I was desperate for an answer, I went with specialists to try to figure out what was going on. In a bittersweet turn of events, I didn't have any specific conditions, other than a couple of altered levels that might or might not explain my symptoms and that were 'easily' fixed with diet and exercise. This to me was both relieving and daunting. On one hand, it gave me relief to know that I didn't have insulin resistance, I didn't have any specific condition, and that I was 'normal', whatever that means. On the other, I felt like I was no closer to feeling better. I didn't have a pill, or treatment to 'fix' me, and I would just have to try harder at all these things I've failed at before to see if that helped.

## So what is this?

This is an attempt at documenting what happened after these mixed feelings, what things are working and what things aren't. And also, hopefully, give me a sense of accomplishment and something to look forward to that I greatly miss in these moments.
I found myself wanting to share tips, tricks, insights, tidbits of information that resonated with me, small wins, and found myself basically blogging it to my best friend through WhatsApp. This journal is meant to save her from all my nonsense, have a place to look back to, and maybe help someone else along the way, if this ever gets shared somewhere.

There is not really a way to wrap this up, I guess just let's try and see where it goes.
