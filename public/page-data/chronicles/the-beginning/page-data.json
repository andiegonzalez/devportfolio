Not only to achieve my goals or my dreams or whatever, but because what I was doing day to day was only going to get me so far. I don't know why I thought this would last me longer, but in a weird way I'm glad it happened now.</p>\n<h2>What Happened</h2>\n<p>As we're all aware, the pandemic came to shake everyone's health, fears, anxieties and life in general in a pretty drasti way. And like many of us, little by little these changes, seemingly without me noticing, started eating away at me. The constant worries, the moving back home, the lack of space, the common routine of not knowing what was next. I started closing in on myself, focusing one day at a time until something made sense again.\nOnce I moved to Mexico City, things started looking up. I was happier, I had my own space, I was living with my boyfriend, I had more power over my routine, everything seemed to get better...until it didn't.</p>\n<p>Symptoms started creeping up: the fatigue, the loneliness, the tiredness, the low energy, the hopelesness, the sadness, the insomnia. All at once, all encompassing. I kept going over these things with my therapist, around and around in circles trying to find the root of all my symptoms, of all my feelings, getting desperate to find a solution to what I was feeling. I tried, but nothing seemed to work, or make me feel at least a little bit better. It went on until my therapist suggested to look into hormone imbalances, insulin resistance, or a thyroid issue. My symptoms had lasted for too long, and they didn't seem like a feelings issue entirely.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"1 Aug 2022","path":"/chronicles/the-beginning","title":"The Beginning of it All"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3116433873","63159454","760776693"]}
