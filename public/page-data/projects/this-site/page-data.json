First and foremost, <strong>build a portfolio that would get me in the door of the tech industry</strong>.\nOther goals I had in order to build this was to have a corner of the internet in which I could <strong>host and manage my own content</strong> in the journey to becoming a frontend engineer.</p>\n<h2>The Process</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Define requirements and tools</p>\n<p>This website is built with Gatsby and hosted on Netlify.\nI chose Gatsby because it was the perfect opportunity to learn something new, while still developing my skills with React. As a performant static site generator, it was a great alternative to using another technology and it met all the requirements I had for my site. I also went for TailwindCSS as a style framework that became my favorite way of styling components.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wireframes &#x26; Design using Figma</p>\n<p>Figma was an essential part of the design process where I storyboarded, wireframed and designed everything from the logo and branding, to the layout and distribution of information. After several iterations, I got to a point where I was comfortable starting the development process. At this stage, nothing was final, I kept tweaking it as I went along.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gatsby Project Setup</p>\n<p>After design, I deep dived into Gatsby's amazing documentation <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/\">(which you can check out here)</a>. The start blog template was very straightfoward to learn and implement and I started adjusting it to better fit my needs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Development &#x26; Testing</p>\n<p>Developing this website while learning new technologies was an interesting challenge. It was a process of jumping back and forth between documentation and coding and back again, but it proved to be an awesome way to learn. I sectioned components that I was going to use often throughout the site, defined a page structure, and selected assets. After each page was done, I tested the responsiveness and how it should change according to different screen sizes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Writing Content</p>\n<p>The last part was generating content to go into each project page and blog post. At the time of writing this, there are not much pieces of content, but hopefully that will change and you reading this will get value out of it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Explore the Source Code</h2>\n<p>I you would like to deep dive into the code of this website you can go directly to the Github repository with the link below.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/andreagzz11/devportfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Github Repository</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"30 Sep 2019","path":"/projects/this-site","title":"Andie Gonzalez's Dev Portfolio","demo":null,"repo":"github.com/andreagzz11/devportfolio","description":"Portfolio & blog site designed form scratch developed with Gatsby & TailwindCSS."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
