Hey stranger! Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

Since I started transitioning from coding as a hobby to actually considering it a career, I've wanted to make something where I could not only show others what I could do, but that I could also teach and inspire others to do the same. As it is common in this industry, impostor syndrome is a real thing that kept me from finally finishing and sharing it with the world. I'm now confident that I have a lot to offer and I'm ready to share with others my journey and my abilities. Even though this site is not perfect yet, my first blog posts are not going to be as good as I would like, I'm ready to start learning in public and hopefully I'll help others as well.

So in the spirit of learning in public, here are some of my goals starting today that I want to hold myself accountable to and I hope that you, dear reader, will enjoy following along.

- Start writing a blog post at least once a week.

  I'd love to write about technical topics around Vue, React & CSS, as well as about what it's like working in the tech industry, my journey, & what I've been learning.

- Grow my community and network on Twitter.

  Twitter, even though it could be a shit show sometimes, has been an incredible tool to get to know other professionals, learn, & get to know other perspectives. I'd love to become a source of knowledge and valuable member of the tech community in a way that inspires and motivates others.

- Eventually, become a speaker at events & conferences, give workshops & courses around the world.

  This maybe might be that hardest goal to achieve out of all of the previous ones, but being able to share and communicate in person in real time the knowledge and content that I'll be generating online is one of my main goals. Not only because it may involve traveling, work opportunities, etc., but because the human aspect of sharing content is unique in its own way that won't be the same as sharing it in a tweet.

So what's next? If my journey sounds exciting and/or interesting to you, please consider following me on social media! I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_andiegonzalez), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andiegonzalez/) & [DEV](https://dev.to/_andiegonzalez).
