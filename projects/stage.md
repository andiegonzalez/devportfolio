**Proyected Stage** is a project management platform designed and implemented by **Proyected**, a Mexican business development company for which I've been working almost full time since October 2018 as a Frontend Developer and UI/UX Designer.

Project Goal:

This platform allows you to have your own organization, in which you can create and manage projects and invite team members to assign tasks inside a given project.

Proyected Stage is built with a Vue.js frontend, using Axios to connect with our server and Charts.js, and is coded by two frontend and one backend developers.

Some other techniques and technologies throughout the project:

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 and Sass
- SVGs

Since it's still a privately charged and implemented platform, public links are not available.
