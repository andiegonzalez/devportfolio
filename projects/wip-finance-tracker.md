## Objective

This is my final project before graduating from my BA in Animation & Digital Art, due December 2019. The Integrative Project consists of team or individual projects that can sum up knowldge acquired throughout our degree and that serves as a strong portfolio piece. 

I developed the concept for a personal finance tracker that was goal oriented, and that could be simple and straight forward. 

## The Process
1. Wireframing & Visual Design

>The concept came form a previous protoype I had made, and I decided to expand it to accomodate not just a income/expense tracker, but that you could also track goals and your progress based on entries, like a virtual piggy bank.

2. Selecting Tools & Tech

>As with my personal site, using Gatsby was an inmense help in picking up react again, and since I work primarily with Vue, practicing React was my main priority. I also decided to use a GraphQL + Node server in order to learn and step out of my comfort zone. 

3. Development, Microinteractions, & Animations

>Work In Progress

4. Testing

>Work In Progress
